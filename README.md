## Getting Started
The web project is not hosted and is therefore not available via the Internet / URL.<br>
The project was also developed using the IBM Cloud IDE. Setup not tested on private IDE.<br>
<br>
Setup description from the course (slightly modified for my own project) in the IBM Cloud IDE:<br>
1. Clone repository
2. Change terminal path to folder "conference-expense-planner-app". E.g.:
```
cd conference-expense-planner-app
```
3. Install necessary packages to execute the application using npm:
```
npm install
```
4. Execute this command to run the application, which will start the application server running on port number 4173.<br>
In IBM Cloud IDE there was an extra feature for this, where the port was entered and the application was started.<br>
```
npm run preview
```
